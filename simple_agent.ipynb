      "helpful_assistance > Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible, modular, and open-source framework designed for developers to create, deploy, and orchestrate AI agents. It aims to make agent development more like traditional software development, offering fine-grained control over agent behavior, orchestration, and tool usage directly within the code. The ADK is model-agnostic, meaning it can work with various large language models (LLMs) beyond just Google's Gemini, and is also deployment-agnostic. It is built to be compatible with other frameworks and supports features like state management, callbacks, streaming, and structured input/output.\n",
